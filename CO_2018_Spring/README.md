# NCTU Computer Organization 2018(Spring)
NCTU Computer Organization lab(1~5)

Learning how to build a 32-bit CPU by verilog, and evaluating cache performance(including LRU, L1 L2 cache, and so on).

### LAB1: [Building a 32-bit ALU using verilog](https://github.com/scdsr/NCTU-CS-assignments/tree/master/CO_2018_Spring/LAB1)
With operations `AND, OR, ADDU, SUBU, NOR, NAND, SLTU, SLEU, SNE, SEQ, SGEU, SGTU`
### LAB2: [Building a single-cycle 32-bit CPU](https://github.com/scdsr/NCTU-CS-assignments/tree/master/CO_2018_Spring/LAB2)
A CPU runs on MIPS instructions.
### LAB3: [Single-cycle CPU with jump and branch instructions](https://github.com/scdsr/NCTU-CS-assignments/tree/master/CO_2018_Spring/LAB3)
Adding `J, JAL, BNEZ and so on.`
### LAB4: [Cache simulation and LRU cache](https://github.com/scdsr/NCTU-CS-assignments/tree/master/CO_2018_Spring/LAB4)
Evaluating cache performance
### LAB5: [Cache performance, calculating clock cycles](https://github.com/scdsr/NCTU-CS-assignments/tree/master/CO_2018_Spring/LAB5)
Two-level-memory's stall cycle(miss penalty) not yet finished, for reference.
